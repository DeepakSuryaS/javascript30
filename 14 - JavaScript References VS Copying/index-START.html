  <title>JS Reference VS Copy</title>

  <script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // these data types will copy values instead of referencing the existing one. python does the same.

    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age; // copies value
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 300;
    console.log(age, age2); // 300 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // references the original array
    console.log(team, players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // original is modified. python does the same
    
    // now here is the problem! we have edited the original array too!
    console.log(team, players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // copies array
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    // or
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;
    console.log(captain, person);
    // but we can't
    // so how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 }); // syntax -> target, source 1, source 2
    console.log(cap2);

    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // dev.social.twitter = '@coolman'; // changes in the original array too. because it is two levels deep.

    /* json stringify the object so that it's no longer an object but a string and parse it again to convert it back to an object. this goes deep. */
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
